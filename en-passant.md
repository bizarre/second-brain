# En passant
* A move in [[chess]]
* Special pawn capture that can only happen right after a pawn makes a move of two squares (from its starting square) where it couldve been captured by an enemy pawn if it had moved only one square
* Opponent captures moved pawn as it passes through the first square
* Result is the same as if the pawn had moved only one square and was captured by the enemy
