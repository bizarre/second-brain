# Morphological Linguistic Change
* Refers to the structural changing of words

## Latin
##### How [[first-declension-latin-noun]]s and [[second-declension-latin-noun]]s come into English:
* No change:
  * arena
  * circus
  * campus
* Latin stem becomes the first English deriviative
  * forma -> form
  * campus -> camp
  * signum -> sign
* Stem + silent *-e*
  * causa -> cause
  * fortuna -> fortune  
  * if the latin noun ends in *-tia*, *-tium* or *-cium*, it is usually a *-ce* instead of *-e*  
    * gratia -> grace
    * officium -> office
    * vitium -> vice
* Major/unpredictable (dictionary needed)
  * camera -> chamber (lol?)
